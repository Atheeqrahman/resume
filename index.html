      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        As a computer science student with a passion for data science and analytics, I have honed my skills in various programming languages including Python and SQL. My experience in these languages has allowed me to gain a deep understanding of data structures and algorithms, as well as their applications in solving real-world problems.

In addition to my programming expertise, I am currently developing my proficiency in data visualization and machine learning using R. I believe that these skills will be essential in enabling me to communicate insights from complex datasets to stakeholders in a clear and concise manner.

My ultimate goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to contribute to a team that values innovation and data-driven decision-making. I am excited about the prospect of working alongside like-minded individuals to tackle complex business problems using cutting-edge technology and analytical tools. I am confident that my passion, drive, and technical expertise will make me a valuable addition to any team.
